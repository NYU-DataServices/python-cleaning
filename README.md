# Data Cleaning and Management Using Python

### Overview

This session is an intermediate level class that will examine ways to perform data cleaning, transformation, and management using Python. We will look at some helpful ways to load data and parse it into a container for ease of use in Python, to store it in helpful formats, and to perform some basic cleaning and transformations typical for mixed string-and-numeric formats. Finally, we'll try putting it all together using a dataset form the NYC Open Data portal.
