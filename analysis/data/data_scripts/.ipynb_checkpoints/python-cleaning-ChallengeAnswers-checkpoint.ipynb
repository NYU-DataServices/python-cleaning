We will look at some helpful ways to load data and parse it into a container for ease of use in Python, to store it in helpful formats, and to perform some basic cleaning and transformations typical for mixed string-and-numeric formats. Finally, we'll try putting it all together using a dataset form the NYC Open Data portal.\n",
